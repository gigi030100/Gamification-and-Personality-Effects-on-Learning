# Link between Gamifified learning materials and Personality on Learning
Due to the continuous growth of technology, demand for skilled IT labour will persist. However, recent studies indicate a decrease in the pursuit of IT and computing srudies due to its complexity (Mezak and Papark, 2018). This posits potential issues with keeping the technological industry abundant with a competent labour pool. Previous literatures have uncovered the usefulness of assimilating game elements in learning materials to reduce complexities, enhancing motivation and engagement among students, especially when these game elements complement the learner's characteristics. 
My project attempted to investigate the link between gamified learning materials and their personality traits (focusing on openness trait) on MCQ score of participants. To do this, I incorporated a Two-sample T-test and moderation analysis.
