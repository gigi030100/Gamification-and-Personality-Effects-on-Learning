# Link between Gamifified learning materials and Personality on Learning
Due to the continuous growth of technology, demand for skilled IT labour will persist. However, recent studies indicate a decrease in the pursuit of IT and computing srudies due to its complexity (Mezak and Papark, 2018). This posits potential issues with keeping the technological industry abundant with a competent labour pool. Previous literatures have uncovered the usefulness of assimilating game elements in learning materials to reduce complexities, enhancing motivation and engagement among students, especially when these game elements complement the learner's characteristics. 
My project attempted to investigate the link between a gamified learning material for data science and their personality traits (focusing on openness trait) on MCQ score of participants. To do this, I incorporated a Two-sample T-test between learners who were exposed to the gamified vs non-gamified learning material. A moderation analysis was also used to determine whether the relationship between gamified learning material and learning outcome was strengthened by openness personality traits.
